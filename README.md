GoHop
=====
GoHop is a VPN implemented in golang, with innate encryption and obfuscation. The goal of this project is to escape from censorship and
intelligent package inspection.

Why Reinvent the Wheel?
------

There're already lots of VPN solutions like OpenVPN, L2TP with IPSec, PPTP and other commercial VPNs. But one key problem of these VPNs are
that they're only built for anti-censorship instead of anti-GFW, of course, because their developers are not Chinese.

In the past, encrypting packets is enough to get through GFW, but around Nov. 2012, with the upgrading of GFW, where DPI(deep packet
inspection) and Machine Learning was introduced, although they cannot decrypt the packets and see the contents, they can still detect
there're HTTP packets encrypted inside VPN packets, thus both OpenVPN and SSH tunnel was blocked in China.

How to Escape from DPI
------

There's no silver bullet to escape from the intelligent GFW, except for revolution :). All what I'm going to do are temporal solutions.

First, OpenVPN and SSH are both built on top of SSL, which has distinct handshake character and can be easily detected by GFW. Second, all
present VPN solutions are single-port or single-protocol, thus the flow can be captured easily and with the help of machine learning, new
protocols can be inspected, too.

So I'm going to implement a VPN with these features:

1. Pre-shared key based authentication, randomly generated key for encryption. NO SSL, maybe a reinvented SSL :).
2. "Frequency hopping"-like port and protocol hopping, both handshake and packet transmission will be actually done in random port and protocol.
3. Traffic shaping to hide protocol's statistical properties.

Notice
-------

GoHop is built on top of Linux's `tun/tap` device. **Currently it supports neither Windows nor OS X**

I think it would not be very difficult to port it to OS X. However, I'm not able to develop a OS X edition as I'm not a mac owner. If
u wanna help, please fork and send me pull requests, I'd appreciate it.

How To Use
------

### Download

You can get updated release from https://github.com/nikola43/gohop/releases , go programs are static-linked, so it's very likely that my
pre-built releases can run on your box.

### Build and Install

**Building GoHop needs Go 1.1 or higher.**

gohop is a go-gettable package:

```
go get github.com/nikola43/gohop
```

### Config and Run

On the server, if u are using it for anti-GFW internet access, ip forwarding is needed:

```
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
```

edit `server.ini` as your server's config file. Run
```
gohop server.ini
```

at client side, edit `client.ini` as your config file, custom routes is supported so that in-china network packets will not go through gohop. Run
```
gohop client.ini
```
wait until u see `Connection Initialized`, pay attention to your DNS config, if u are using a Chinese DNS server, u're still unable to
access blocked websites.

now try to ping `twitter.com` and cheers :).
